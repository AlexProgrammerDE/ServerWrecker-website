   steps and see if they are the same for your server

2. Remove your ./plugins/SkinsRestorer/plugin.yml & Messages.yml files

3. Update the plugin if needed! [(SpigotMC)](https://spigotmc.org/resources/2124/)

# Advanced Troubleshoot

### Commands not working

If commands are not working, you need to make sure that you did follow our specific installation instructions. if it
still does not work, try removing the config and messages and restart your bungee and if not bungee your spigot server.
for perms check our permissions section.

### Plugin incompatibility

Some not well coded plugins or plugins that modify the user profile might not work well with SkinsRestorer.
You can see this when you for example change a skin, and you see the chunks reload but your skin just won't apply...

*List of known incompatibility's:*

- MundoSK
- scripting plugins in general
- some mods
- plugins that use ProtocoLib

To figure out IF it's a plugin incompatibility the best thing to do is running your server with SkinsRestorer as the only plugin
and see if it than works. if so you can try adding plugins and check each time if the plugin still works. this way you
can identify the plugin that might cause this.

### Server Incompatibility

We do not support forge, only CatServer some times..

we also don't support FlameCord as they change the loginresult.Property somehow and the sourcecode can not be found.

# Connection

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

*SkinsRestorer needs connection to download skin data, you can test your current connection using `/sr status`*

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  WARNING ABOUT api.github.com? can be ignored for now!

How are you hosting your server?
[ [Local](#resolve-local-firewall) / [Minecraft server hosting (panel)](#resolve-mc-provider-firewall) / [VPS & Dedicated server hosting (root access)](#resolve-dedi-server-firewall) ]
***

## Resolve Local Firewall

Please select System:

[ [Linux](#resolve-local-firewall-linux) / [Windows](#resolve-local-firewall-windows) ]

### Resolve Local Firewall Linux

### Resolve Local Firewall Windows

## Resolve MC Provider Firewall

When you only have access to a panel like multicraft or cpanel, you are not able to change firewall settings.

IF you do have access to ssh / root command line, go to -> [Dedi server](#resolve-dedi-server-firewall)

Use Below template to create a ticket / send @ to your Minecraft hosting provider

```
Firewall issues - this is a email template copied from github:SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX

Dear Mc-Service provider,

I believe that your firewall setup is restricting one of my plugins to work properly, namely, SkinsRestorer.
In order to allow it to function properly, I need to be able to open new outgoing connections to specific HTTP API services. You can see the list of required traffic at https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX/wiki/Troubleshooting#firewall-passthrough-requirements.

I kindly request that you permit such traffic for all Minecraft hosting services associated with my account.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact SkinsRestorer's team via:
Discord - https://skinsrestorer.net/discord
Email - support@skinsrestorer.net

Kind regards.
```

## Resolve dedi server Firewall

The following script should allow new and established connections.

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1  -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED     -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED     -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo update-ca-certificates -f
sudo /var/lib/dpkg/info/ca-certificates-java.postinst configure
```

Or you can see [Firewall pass through requirements](#firewall-pass-through-requirements) to manually allow api.

#### Firewall pass through requirements

> All the required rules are **outgoing**, the only incoming traffic that should be accepted is the one from already
> established connections. Your server must be able to connect to the other networks. SkinsRestorer does **not** require
> any incoming traffic from new connections to be accepted.
