# Installing SkinsRestorer

## Creator notes

In here you can find everything you need for your first time installation of SkinsRestorer as well as the recommended
way of doing so. If you are having issues or questions while installing feel free to ask questions on
our [discord server](https://skinsrestorer.net/discord).

## Requirements

To be able tho use SkinsRestorer on your server, little is needed:

(note: Most Minecraft server hosting companies have all of this)

* Java from at least version 8
* Internet connection through ports 80 (http) & 443 (https) & 53 (dns) (
  issues? > [troubleshoot connection](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX/wiki/Troubleshoot#connection))
* Minecraft server versions and variants that we
  support [[check overview](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX/blob/master/README.md)]

## Basic Installation

In this section you can read how to set up our plugin SkinsRestorer your for Spigot server, BungeeCord network or even
for Sponge server!
In here we only learn to implement the plugin, to set up OR Trouble shoot: WIP

#### Installing Spigot

[!] If you're using BungeeCord (or any other proxy system), you must follow the [BungeeCord](#installing-Bungee)
installation process.

1. Download the latest version from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skinsrestorer.2124/
2. Place the SkinsRestorer.jar in the ./plugins/ folder.
3. Restart the server. (Only use `/restart` or `/stop` Do NOT use `/reload`, As `/reload` will break
   SR!)[Plugman is also not supported]
4. That's it! Our plugin should now show in /plugins folder

  plugin: [[Config Guide](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX/wiki/Configuration#config-guide)]

### Installing Bungee

1. Download the latest version from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skinsrestorer.2124/
2. Place the SkinsRestorer.jar in ./plugins/ folders of **every spigot** server.
3. Place the SkinsRestorer.jar in ./plugins/ folder of every **BungeeCord** server.
4. Check & set on **every backend** server (spigot/paper) `spigot.yml` -> `bungeecord: true`
5. (OPTIONAL) set in __bungee__ -> config.yml -> `ip_forward: true`
6. Restart (`/restart` or `/stop`) all servers
   [Plugman or /reload are NOT supported, use /stop or /end]
7. BungeeCord now has SkinsRestorer installed with the integration of Spigot
8. You may now **Configure SkinsRestorer on Bungee** (BungeeCord plugins folder `/plugins/SkinsRestorer`)

  Bungee: [[Config Guide](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX/wiki/Configuration#config-guide)]

### Installing SpongeVanilla (NOT SpongeForge)

1. Download the latest version from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skinsrestorer.2124/
2. Place the plugin in ./mods/ folder (where Sponge is located).
3. Restart the server.
4. That's it!

### Installing Velocity

**[!] Paper is suggested for velocity [!]**

1. Download the latest version from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skinsrestorer.2124/
2. Place the SkinsRestorer.jar in ./plugins/ folders of every Paper server.
3. Place the SkinsRestorer.jar in ./plugins/ folder of every Velocity server.
4. Check & set on every backend server (paper) paper.yml ->   velocity-support: enabled: true
5. Restart (/restart or /stop) all servers [Plugman or /reload are NOT supported, use /stop or /end]
6. You may now Configure SkinsRestorer on Velocity (Velocity plugins folder /plugins/SkinsRestorer)

(if you're not using paper, use Proxy mode override file. Ask us on discord)

## Advanced Installation

### Securing Bungee Networks

#### What happened?

Because the plugin is open source and a lot of bungee network owners are not blocking off ports using firewall, we see
hack client makers abusing a vulnerability caused by not securing bungee networks.

This security issue comes from the channel we use between bungee and spigot for opening the GUI menu, getting selected
actions back to bungee, and also sending skin data to bukkit to use for instaskinchange (so users don't need to rejoin)

#### How should I secure my self?

You should secure your backend servers by only allowing bungee to connect to it over the server port. this can be done
by using iptables on both bungee and spigot, or other measurements that block off non-whitelisted connections over the
port server ports. We advise you to host both bungee & spigot by your self and not use Minecraft server hosting where
you can not secure your ports, or change firewall settings.

We will create a step-by-step guide soon to educate bungee network owners and how to secure themselves for network
related exploits.

#### What if I can not secure myself?

If you can not secure yourself, we advise you not to put the jar on the spigot side. This will mitigate the risk at the
cost of skins GUI and instaskinchange (you would need to rejoin or change server)
