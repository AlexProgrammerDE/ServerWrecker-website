## Advanced Installation

### Securing Bungee Networks

#### What happened?

Because the plugin is open source and a lot of bungee network owners aren't blocking off ports using firewall, we see
hack client makers abusing a vulnerability caused by not securing bungee networks.

This security issue comes from the channel we use between bungee and spigot for opening the GUI menu, getting selected
actions back to bungee, and also sending skin data to bukkit to use for instaskinchange (so users don't need to rejoin)

#### How should I secure my self?

You should secure your backend servers by only allowing bungee to connect to it over the server port. This can be done
by using iptables on both bungee and spigot, or other measurements that block off non-whitelisted connections over the
port server ports. We advise you to host both bungee & spigot by your self and not use Minecraft server hosting where
you can't secure your ports, or change firewall settings.

We will create a step-by-step guide soon to educate bungee network owners and how to secure themselves for network-related exploits.

#### What if I can't secure myself?

If you can't secure yourself, we advise you not to put the jar on the spigot side. This will mitigate the risk at the
cost of SkinsGUI and instaskinchange (you would need to rejoin or change server)
