# Import Accounts

SoulFire supports Microsoft Java, Microsoft Bedrock, EasyMC, The Altening and Offline accounts.

If no account is selected, SoulFire will generate offline accounts based on the configured name format.

Select the account type in the GUI or CLI and use one of these formats with one account per line:

## Microsoft Java

The account needs to have bought Minecraft Java Edition.

```text
email:password
email2:password2
email3:password3
```

## Microsoft Bedrock

This is the only way to attack Bedrock Edition servers.
On Bedrock there is no game ownership check, so any Microsoft account can play on any Bedrock Edition server.
You need to have Xbox Live enabled on the account and have a gamer tag.

```text
email:password
email2:password2
email3:password3
```

## EasyMC

Accounts from [EasyMC.io](https://easymc.io/).

```text
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
```

## The Altening

Accounts from [The Altening](https://thealtening.com/).

```text
token@alt.com
token2@alt.com
token3@alt.com
```

## Offline

Offline accounts are generally case-sensitive and can be used to attack servers that have explicitly set online-mode to false in their server.properties file.
So both `username` and `UserName` are valid offline accounts and can play at the same time.
Minecraft generates a case-sensitive UUID for each username, so the server can differentiate between them.
Most auth plugins like AuthMe however will block offline accounts that are spelled the same but have different cases.

```text
Username
Username2
Username3
```
