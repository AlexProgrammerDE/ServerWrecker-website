### AutoRespawn

Automatically respawns bots with a random delay when they die.
Bots do not cause a lot of lags when they are dead, so this module is useful for ensuring
that the bots are always alive and performing their actions.

### AutoRegister

Automatically runs `/register` and `/login` on cracked servers.
Also supports `/captcha` for servers that have it.

### AutoJump

Automatically jumps with a random delay.
Useful for slowing the server down.
It will also make the bots send a lot of movement packets,
which is useful for testing the server's performance.

### ClientSettings & ClientBrand

Configurable client settings like chat visibility, chat colours, skin customization, and more.
Client brand can also be changed to any string; by default, it's set to "vanilla".
Useful for bypassing anti-bot plugins that check for client settings.
