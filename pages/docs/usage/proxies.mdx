# Import Proxies

SoulFire allows you to use proxies to hide your IP address and bypass IP limits on servers.

## Looking for proxies?

There are many websites that offer free proxies, but be careful as many of them are not reliable or secure.

If you need a good proxy service, I recommend [Webshare](https://www.webshare.io/?referral_code=36gneippfiwt)
(I get commissions for purchases made through this link).
I've used Webshare for my own projects and tried other services such as [ProxyScrape](https://proxyscrape.com/),
but they come nowhere close to the quality of Webshare.
Webshare offers both free and premium proxies and is a reliable and secure service.

## Proxy types

SoulFire supports HTTP, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.

Select the proxy type in the GUI or CLI and use one of these formats with one proxy per line:

### HTTP

```text
ip:port <- no authentication
ip:port:username:password <- authentication
```

### SOCKS4

```text
ip:port <- no authentication
ip:port:username <- authentication (socks4 doesn't support passwords)
```

### SOCKS5

```text
ip:port <- no authentication
ip:port:username:password <- authentication
```

### URI

This format allows you to use multiple proxy types in one file.

```text
socks5://ip:port <- socks5 & no authentication
socks5://username:password@ip:port <- socks5 & authentication
socks4://ip:port <- socks4 & no authentication
socks4://username@ip:port <- socks4 & authentication
http://ip:port <- http & no authentication
http://username:password@ip:port <- http & authentication
```
