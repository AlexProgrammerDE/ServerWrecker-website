# Installation on Windows

Before installing, we recommend you to read the [main installation page](/docs/installation).

## Basic Installation

In this section, you can read how to set up SoulFire on your Windows PC.

<Steps>
    ### Download the software
    Download the latest Windows installer from [the front page](/).

    ### Run the installer
    Go into the folder where you downloaded the installer and double-click it.

    ### Ignore warnings
    You may receive a warning from Windows Defender or your browser. You can ignore this warning and continue.

    This is a common issue with new software that doesn't have a lot of downloads yet.

    ### Follow the installer
    Follow the installer's instructions. You can leave most settings at their default values.

    ### That's it!
    You should now have SoulFire installed on your Windows PC. You can now open it from the Start menu, the Desktop icon or by searching for it.
