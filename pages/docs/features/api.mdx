To makes things more easy, we created an example plugin that connects to the coding API that can be found
here: [[link](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerAPIExample)]

#### When using BungeeCord/Velocity?

If you are using BungeeCord/Velocity you must have a plugin that calls to the API on BungeeCord/Velocity. You would need
to use in/out put channels to send this information across both of your custom plugins.

Getting issues?

* make sure to import the `net.skinsrestorer.api.SkinsRestorerAPI` & `net.skinsrestorer.api.PlayerWrapper` in your
  code (see example code)
* make sure to get the API using `skinsRestorerAPI = SkinsRestorerAPI.getApi()`  and define by
  adding `private SkinsRestorerAPI skinsRestorerAPI;` at the start of your class.
* if you don't know that the issue is causing, include a try catch, so you can print our exceptions using e.print... etc

# Using Plugin Message Channel

If you are using BungeeCord/Velocity, and you want your plugin to work from spigot. You could use [*Plugin Message
Channel*](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bukkit-bungee-plugin-messaging-channel/) to send the commands to bungee cord.

### Messages list

sr:message is only to "forward" commands from spigot to bungee. This includes cooldown, permissions checks and always
send feedback to player.
If you want to run it as console (without checks) you will have to wait for sr:adminchannel

to bungee:
| Message (sr:messagechannel +) |
|:-----------------------------:|
| setSkin p skin/url |
| clearSkin p |
| getSkins page |

to bukkit:
| Message |
|:---------------------------------------------:|
| sr:messagechannel OPENGUI p |
| sr:skinchange SkinUpdate name value signature |

### Sending a message

wip

first you need to register the channel (on startup)
`Bukkit.getMessenger().registerOutgoingPluginChannel(this, "sr:messagechannel");`

example of how we send `/skin set <player> <skin>` over plugin message channel:

```java
        try {
            ByteArrayOutputStream bytes = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
            DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(bytes);

            out.writeUTF("setSkin");
            out.writeUTF(p.getName());
            out.writeUTF(skin);

            p.sendPluginMessage(this, "sr:messagechannel", bytes.toByteArray());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
```
