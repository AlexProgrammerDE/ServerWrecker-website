### Introduction

Because SkinsRestorer does not have a public API, We have a Development providing 2 simple tools for uploading custom png
files to SkinsRestorer!

### How to generate custom skin

#### Skinfile Generator

we get a lot of questions about how to apply a custom skin, lucky riflowth got you covered!

For small servers we have the following:
[Skinfile Generator]( https://riflowth.github.io/SkinFile-Generator/)

This web app allows you to convert .png skin files to .skin files that are used by SkinsRestorer.
If you use the web application, upload the skin files in the directory where skin data is saved and rename the files to
the usernames they belong to.

### Skin System

If you are a **BIG server network and use bungee** we have a website with **AuthMe integration**:

- [!] Requires MYSQL

"Skin System"
This web app allows your players to upload .png skin files to the database that is used by SkinsRestorer to allow
people can use their own skins without premium account!

#### Manual Generating

1. make sure the file and cape(optional) are online with a .png link
2. decode a skin to use the template (for
   example: [notch](https://sessionserver.mojang.com/session/minecraft/profile/069a79f444e94726a5befca90e38aaf5))
3. replace it with your skin data and make sure all info matches
4. encode it again with base64 and apply it to the matching .skin file
5. make sure you set the 3rd line on 2524608000000 (the year 2050) which will avoid getting the skin invalid

### Apply custom default skins

if you want to apply a default skin for your server you can do the following:

1. set the skin on your own using /skin to load it in the database

2. set the defaultskins to true and add the desired skin

3. restart the or do "/sr reload"

Done!
