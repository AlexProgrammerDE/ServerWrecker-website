# Installing SoulFire

## Creator notes

Here you can find everything you need for your first time installation of SoulFire as well as the recommended way
of doing so.
If you're having issues or questions while installing, feel
free to ask questions on our [discord server](https://soulfiremc.com/discord).

## Requirements

To be able to use SoulFire, little is needed:

* An internet connection to download the software.
* A supported operating system (`Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`) with an `amd64/x86_64` architecture.

## About amd64/x86_64

The software is fully able to run on `aarch64/arm64`, but we do not provide official support for it using the provided
installation methods.
If you want to run SoulFire on `aarch64/arm64`, you will have to manually install `Java 21 or newer`
for your system and then download the universal jar file from the [front page](/).
After that, you can run the jar file using
`java -jar [filename].jar` in the terminal.

Adoptium is the recommended way of installing Java for your system.
You can find the download links for it
[on their website](https://adoptium.net).
