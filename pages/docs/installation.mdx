## Universal distribution (.jar)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Universal installation is for power-users that want to run SoulFire on `aarch64/arm64` or other systems and setups.
    It is not recommended for the average user. For simple installation, please use the platform-specific installation methods above.
</Callout>

The software is fully able to run on `aarch64/arm64`, but we do not provide official support for it using the provided
platform installation methods.
If you want to run SoulFire on `aarch64/arm64`, you will have to manually install `Java 21 or newer`
for your system.

Adoptium is the recommended way of installing Java for your system.
You can find the download links for it
[on their website](https://adoptium.net).

Then download the universal client jar file from the [front page](/).
After that, you can run the jar file in the terminal using the following command:

```bash
java -Xmx$RAM -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M -jar SoulFireClient.jar
```

Replace `$RAM` with the amount of RAM you want to allocate to the instance.
For example, to allocate 2GB of RAM, you would use `-Xmx2G`.
If there is no RAM specified, the instance will use 25% of the total RAM available on the system.
If your machine does not have a display, or you provide CLI flags after `SoulFireClient.jar`,
you will be forced to use [CLI Mode](/docs/guides/cli-mode).
In any other case, the software will launch in [GUI Mode](/docs/guides/gui-mode).
