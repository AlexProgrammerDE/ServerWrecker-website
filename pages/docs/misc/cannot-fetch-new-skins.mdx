# Cannot fetch new skins

If, by running `/sr status` you get the following red message:

`> Plugin currently can't fetch new skins. You might check out our discord at [redacted]`

Then this means your server cannot connect to the APIs the plugin requires to work.

## How to fix it?

This is a good question, and you are the right place to get an answer.
Our plugin needs the following APIs over the following ports to be functional:

| URL                       | Port     |
|---------------------------|----------|
| https://api.minetools.eu/ | 443 - 53 |
| https://api.mojang.com/   | 443 - 53 |
| https://api.ashcon.app/   | 443 - 53 |
| https://api.mineskin.org/ | 443 - 53 |
